Today's Lick
------------

Starts at approximately 00:17 of
`this link <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fryGyqTJPU>`_.

The thought process
-------------------

First, there's the A-A'-A-A' structure.
Another way of looking at it is ABACABAC.

A part
------

This consists of six notes in groups of two.
The first note is always the same.
I'm not sure the term "pedal tone" is used in this context,
but it's something like that.

The first interval is pretty strong.
I consider the fifth and the fourth.
I start to sing the tones and get the impression the first interval is
probably a fifth. I'm going to go with P5, P4, m3.

I play the part back on the old axe, it's P5, P4, M3.
The latter explains the joyful sound.

B part
------

This starts with the same pedal tone.
The interval is smaller than the previous one, so it's at most a minor third.
It doesn't sound especially sinister, so I'm taking my chances with an M2.
And the more I think about it, it does sound a lot like the "fr√®re Jacques"
interval. So I'm relatively confident about that.

The next note is the same as the sixth note, I think.
I try to sing the three-note sequence without the middle note to compare
that to my idea of an M3, and it fits pretty well.

The next one immediately feels like a P4 from the pedal tone,
which would make sense structurally as well: the lick appears
to be using the same notes going up as down. And the next one
feels like a P5, too. If that's correct, the next note is the
P4 from the pedal tone again.

I play this back and I can't find better intervals, but it feels a little
off. Could be a tone thing. I go for a softer tone by playing with my fingers
instead of with my pick. The pedal tone suggests the use of an open string.
I use B. I don't think it's right, but I do get the impression the intervals
check out.

C part
------

No time today. Given that I haven't analyzed this at all, I'll continue work
on it tomorrow.
