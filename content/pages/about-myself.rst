About myself
============

:slug: about-myself

Name's Vincent.
I'm a computer scientist working at KU Leuven, Belgium.
Specifically, I'm working on a four-year research project on coroutining.

My interests include guitar, literature, linguistics and, of course, programming.
Got some profiles for related networks down in the footer if you're interested.
