Remarks on a quick first reading
--------------------------------

- What does the "fluid" in the new code stand for?
- The ngModel directive is referenced.
  How is it different from what we've seen before?
- Something that looks a lot like a UNIX pipe is used to filter phones  through `filter:query`.
- Is the backing model really bound to an input's `name` in the DOM sense?
- What does the `filter` function filter *on*?
  Phones have different attributes, so which, if any, is used for the
  full-text search and why?
- Jasmine test syntax seems to be worth looking into.
- Does the ngBind template replace the text of the element
  it's associated with, or does it doe something else?
- Is there an `unpause` statement in addition to the `pause`?
