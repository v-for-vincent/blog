:summary: What is asked of me at my new job and how I intend to do it.

Intro
-----

I recently accepted a job as a Java developer.
I write Python mostly, but I wanted to start my career in development.
What my employers have said is that they want "Java superheroes".
That's not what I am.
I'm just competent.
That being said, I want to do a good job, so I'm going to come up with a plan to improve my knowledge of Java.
I believe that there are about five main exercises one should go through to achieve this:

#. Write short programming challenges
#. Contribute to a larger project
#. Read about the language
#. Write about the language
#. Pass the occasional pop quiz
