:summary: What is asked of me at my new job and how I intend to do it.

Intro
-----

I recently accepted a job as a Java developer.
I write Python mostly, but I wanted to start my career in development.
What my employers have said is that they want "Java superheroes".
That's not what I am.
I'm just competent.
That being said, I want to do a good job, so I'm going to come up with a plan to improve my knowledge of Java.
I believe that there are about five main exercises one should go through to achieve this:

#. Write short programming challenges
#. Contribute to a larger project
#. Read about the language
#. Write about the language
#. Pass the occasional quiz

Below, I'll give my roadmap for each of these bullets.
As I get through each, I'll tell you which steps yield the best value.

Read about the language
-----------------------

I read a lot of interesting stuff about Python through Python Weekly
and Pycoder's weekly.
I couldn't find the exact same format for Java, but I did manage to
find "Java Code Geeks" through Feedly.

In addition, I've got Josh Bloch's "Effective Java" on hand.
That's basically the quintessential Java reference, so I'll
work my way through it again.
I already read most of it a few years back, but that was before
I switched to Python. I could do with a refresher.

It's also worth noting that the Pragmatic Programmers have some books
on interesting, very specific Java topics: concurrency on the JVM,
functional programming in Java 8, etc.

I'll also need to work with Java EE and XML.
Turns out O'Reilly is planned to release a book on Java EE 7 next month:
"Java EE 7 Essentials".
Their stuff is usually pretty good, so I'll use that as a reference.

As for XML, I'm not sure yet.
Maybe the book on EE will cover enough of what I need.
