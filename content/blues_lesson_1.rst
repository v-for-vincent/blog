Practice
--------

After working my way through lesson 1, I wrote the following 8-bar tune
to cement the open sevenths and the minor pentatonic scale in the
open position:

The Lilypond source for this composition can be found
`here <|filename|/attachments/greenhorn_goodnight.ly>`_,
so, if you'd like to change the notation, alter the piece
output a midi file you can play back, just check out
`Lilypond <www.lilypond.org>`_. It's easy to learn and it's
got a lot of functionality built in. That said, I'm not
particularly familiar with it yet, so the results aren't
perfect. Throw in some pre-bends etc. wherever they feel
comfortable and you should get what I've got, roughly.

Theory
------

Choosing notes
++++++++++++++

I once read that you can always play the notes in the current scale
safely, as well as those in the scale of the current chord. I tried
playing some notes in the A minor pentatonic while on the IV, but it
didn't sound very good. Go ahead and try it out. Playing notes in the
A dominant 7th chord (or A7) worked, though, so you don't just use the same
type of scale as for the root chord (though you can obviously play notes
from the E7 chord as well).

Now, this gives me the impression that, rather than just arpeggiating,
it might be possible to try notes from a dominant 7 scale of some sort.
Google tells me that the scale I need here is just a major scale with a
flat 7. So, the C dominant 7 scale should be C-D-E-F-G-A-Bb.

Let's try that. I play some different filler notes on the A7 chord
(notably the flat 7) and it does come out sounding pretty good, albeit
a bit inconsistent with the minor pentatonic I've been using for the
other licks. So I decide to use just this scale for filler licks for
a new piece.

Singing along
+++++++++++++

A reliable way to improve relative pitch is to sing chord/note names
as you play them. I use the "movable do" system, in which the classical
note names from "do" to "ti" refer to scale degrees rather than to pitches.
In other words, you sing the syllable "do" for the root, the syllable "re"
for the second scale step, and so on. In other words, I use "A" to "G" to
represent absolute pitches and "do" to "ti" to represent relative pitches.

Of course, you've got your sharps and flats as well. If I've still got
your interest, check out
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge#Movable_do_solf.C3.A8ge`_ to
find out how those are handled.

Because "Greenhorn Goodnight" is in E, E becomes do, F# becomes re,
G# becomes mi, A becomes fa, B sol, C# la, D# ti. Note that the sharps
in this sequence are also the ones pointed out in the key signature for
E major. That's what the key signature means, in fact. More on that when
I get to the circle of fifths in a later article.

Getting to know the fretboard
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I must've learnt the fretboard pretty well at least five times now and
now I find that I can't find my way around it anymore. Playing around
with Fretboard Warrior just doesn't cut it, you need to think about
notes as you use them, too. Using classical notation is one way to
memorize the fretboard better. I'll try to put a helpful tool online to
practise sight-reading pretty soon.
