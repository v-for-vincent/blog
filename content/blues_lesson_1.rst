Practice
--------

After working my way through lesson 1, I wrote the following 8-bar tune
to cement the open sevenths and the minor pentatonic scale in the
open position:

The Lilypond source for this composition can be found

.. todo:: here

so, if you'd like to change the notation, alter the piece
output a midi file you can play back, just check out
`Lilypond <www.lilypond.org>`_. It's easy to learn and it's
got a lot of functionality built in.

I once read that you can always play the notes in the current scale
safely, as well as those in the scale of the current chord. I tried
playing some notes in the A minor pentatonic while on the IV, but it
didn't sound very good. Go ahead and try it out. Playing notes in the
A dominant 7th chord (or A7) worked, though, so you don't just use the same
type of scale as for the root chord (though you can obviously play notes
from the E7 chord as well).
