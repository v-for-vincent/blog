Today's lick
------------

Buckethead is probably about as accomplished as any guitarist can get.
That said, today's lick is part of his mellow repertoire, so it's very
playable. If you're not familiar with it, check it out
`on Youtube <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF5bekbKIbM>`_.
I'll be looking at the haunting first 12 seconds.

The thought process
-------------------

I made an effort to think about the lick beforehand.
To show you this process, I took down notes in different colours.

First, I made tiny groupings of the notes and tried to hear what was
going on in those. Then, I tried to connect them. I got a lot of things
wrong, but I'm happy to say I got a few things right, too.

During take 1, I mostly focused on the overall movement inside the
groupings. I'm hoping the graphical notation is clear enough.

Lessons learnt
--------------

I should also try to focus more on scales.
Maybe less on intervals, but then I may need to get better at those before
I decide to drop them in favour of scales.
