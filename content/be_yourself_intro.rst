:summary: Quick analysis of a Tom Morello lick

Today's lick
------------

I didn't get around to finishing yesterday's lick, but I'm going to do
a new one anyway. Because I think it's best to process plenty of material
in this way. As usual, you can listen to the song on
`YouTube <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC5FdFlUcl0>`_.

Steps
-----

First step: conscious memorization. I've probably head this lick hundreds
of times, but that doesn't mean I know all the nuances. So I listen about
five times, paying extra attention to the nuances.

Then, the initial analysis. I try to pinpoint where the melody goes up and
where it comes back down. I do a pretty crummy job of this, it seems,
because I hear the melody going down on the fourth note, when it is really
going up by four half steps, and I hear it going down again on the sixth
note, when it is once again going up (by two half steps).

I also determine the root. The lick loops back to the initial note, which
resolves very strongly, so that's something of a giveaway. That's it for
the analysis. In retrospective, I should've tried to hear the scale
degrees.

Then, I play it back. Instinctively, my fingers go up when my analysis
said that the notes were going down, so there's definitely some work left
to do on attuning those. Because there are a lot of slides in the song,
I play a one string version. On the B string (because I think that's the
root), it becomes 12-7-10-14-15-17-14-15-10-12.

With that in mind, I write out the notes.
I get B, C#/Db, D, E, F#/Gb and A.
Throw a G in there and you've got yourself a rotation of the
W-W-H-W-W-W-H structure of the diatonic major scale.
In other words, a mode.

I know next to nothing about modes (everything I do know what in the previous
two sentences, really), so I figure now's a good time to find out. Turns
out the pattern matches the Aeolian mode. I try a box shape for it and,
sure enough, I can play the lick without moving my hand around.

Lessons learnt
--------------

Maybe I need to visualize what my hand would be inclined to do to get
an idea of intervals etc. I definitely had fun determining the correct
mode. I'm going to keep doing that.

Total time spent (memorizing up until analysis of last note)
------------------------------------------------------------

16 minutes on initial analysis, about 2 to find the right notes,
about 20 on a posteriori analysis.
