C part
------

We looked at A and B yesterday.
The C part is simply a small closing tag.
The final note resolves quite strongly, so it makes sense to assume
that this is the root. Furthermore, the next-to-last note almost
demands to be resolved. I assume it to be a fifth based on that
impression, but I'm wrong, because it's a fourth.

The notes
---------

So here are the notes we've got:

* root
* M2
* M3
* P4
* P5

So we've got: W-W-H-W-... No need to overcomplicate things:
this is simply the major scale (Ionian mode). I look for a
convenient scale shape and decide on this one:

| -X---X-X--
| -X-X---X--
| -O---X----
| -X---X---X
| -X---X-X--
| -X---X-X--

I think it's best played with fingers (even though I'm no good
at that).
