The song
--------

The song is still at `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db94lyKYOcg`_.
I originally planned to just do "the next bit", excluding the frills
for now. That would be the start of the solo at 1:28-ish.
This is a slide-based solo, which is a nice challenge, because I've
never used a slide before (though I've got one lying around) and
because I find the sound to be very cool.


Analysis
--------

I figured I would start by looking at salient pitches and acting as
though this were a regular single-note melody. That led me to the
following conclusions (which were somewhat off):

1. 9 notes
2. down, down, up pattern repeated twice, then two identical notes
   followed by a sound very similar to a bend-and-release
3. the fourth "note" is a major second below the first
4. the second note is a perfect fourth below the first
5. the third note is a perfect fifth below the first
6. the same pattern determines notes 5, 6 and 7
7. 8 is the same note as 7
8. 9 ends up a perfect fourth below 8

I played this back and noticed that #5 was well off the mark, but that
if I replaced it with a P4 below the note preceding it, I got something
similar to the start of the solo. At least note-wise. But it spectacularly
bad. So I need to figure out how to do this with an actual slide.

Practice
--------

Because I have no experience with a slide, I started off with the very basics:
how to put it on and how to play a single note properly.
The former was easy: I checked how Gibbons puts his on and copied that (second
finger, it's okay if it's kind of loose).
The latter was more challenging: I noticed that I had a tendency to tense up
more than usual and to press down the slide way too hard. So I spent some
25 minutes looking for a fluid motion. The most effective approach for me
involved a few key points:

* keep a fairly loose grip, with the thumb over the neck, but with the hand
  pulled down by gravity
* keep fingers not using the slide stretching excessively
* let the knuckle of the first finger touch, but not press on the neck
* let the knuckle of the fourth finger brush against the neck very lightly
* make sure the pivot does not go up to the shoulder

It's a lot of fun trying to figure out this new technique. I'll probably look
at more ZZ Top stuff because Gibbons uses it extensively in his solos.
