As I was working on a blues study yesterday, something hit me:

   Don't focus on playing it right. Focus on **staying focused**, and focus
   on staying **relaxed**.

Far better players than myself have probably told you that the second part
is important. But it's a matter of emphasis:
if you do the second part right, playing the right notes will come naturally.
And just focusing and relaxing is a far less daunting task than playing a
challenging piece of music.
