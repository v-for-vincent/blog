:summary: Main lick of Just Got Paid

The song
--------

Time to start showing some ambition:
the song is at `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db94lyKYOcg`_.
I'm going to see how much of the whole thing I can play.
Today, we'll do the main lick.

Analysis
--------

First thing I did was look for a very rough relative positioning.
I came up with this:

#. up
#. up
#. down
#. down
#. up
#. down
#. down
#. up

Then, I started looking for a root or intervals.
The last note felt like it should be the root.
The sixth note is the same. So there was a pretty
good anchor point.

Then, I tried to hum the melody to see if there were any recognizable
intervals. Indeed there were: the song starts off on a M2 ("fr√®re Jacques")
Then there's a m3 (the *slightly* ominous one) and you get the same intervals
going back down again. So all of a sudden we've got the first five notes.

Then I noticed that you could "restart" the lick on the fifth note.
Which drew my attention to the fact that the second and sixth note are
the same. And we already knew that the second and fourth note were the same,
as well as the sixth and ninth note. So all we need to find is the seventh
and eighth note. Again, humming did the trick. Going from 6 to 7 gives a
very playful-sounding interval (at least to my ears). That's the major third.
And going from the eighth to the ninth note gives a strong, medieval type
of interval: the perfect fifth.

I was pretty surprised to find that I got all the notes this time.
I'm choosing to believe I've gotten a bit better already.
